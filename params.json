{"name":"Leitwarte.GitHub.io","tagline":"Web pages for the Leitwarte project","body":"### Leitwarte. Take control of your deployments. For Meteor.\r\n\r\n[Leit-war-te](https://www.howtopronounce.com/german/leitwarte/): A place with lots of knobs and monitors to monitor and run a complex plant. German for control room. \r\n\r\n![Control Room](assets/controlroom.jpg)\r\n\r\nLeitwarte is a tool to manage hosts, deploy software using [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) and Meteor applications via [Docker/mup](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up).\r\n\r\nThe project is under heavy development and it is still very young. Lots to do... see the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Fracwcz8/leitwarte-roadmap). Wanna help out?\r\n\r\nFirst priority is to get fundamental functions for simple deployments implemented. Second priority is a modular architecture to allow easy inclusion of additional deployment methods and technologies.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nFor ease of use you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to deploy Leitwarte. That way you do not need to know anything about Meteor, the underlying technology used for Leitwarte.\r\nLeitwarte needs a MongoDB to connect to. If you do not have one, you can start a Docker container for it:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run --name leitwarte-mongo -d mongo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run the leitwarte container using\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -d \\\r\n-e ROOT_URL=http://leitwarte.local \\\r\n-e MONGO_URL=mongodb://leitwarte-mongo:27017 \\\r\n-p 80:3000 \\\r\n--link leitwarte-mongo:mongo \\\r\n--name leitwarte-web \\\r\nleitwarte/leitwarte\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe project was founded by @yauh with contributions from @ciwolsey and @devonbarrett.
